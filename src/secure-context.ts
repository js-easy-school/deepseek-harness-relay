/**
 * A UUID for a page the browser refuses to call secure.
 *
 * `crypto.randomUUID` is `[SecureContext]`: browsers expose it over HTTPS and
 * on loopback, and nowhere else.
 *
 * **Harness 0.1.2 fixed this upstream.** `randomUuid()` in
 * `packages/client/connection/src/client/random-uuid.ts` now builds a v4 UUID
 * from `crypto.getRandomValues()`, which browsers do expose on an insecure
 * origin, so a 0.1.2 page served from a plain-HTTP LAN address works without
 * this shim.
 *
 * It is kept for the harness releases before that. Through 0.1.1 the browser
 * client minted ids with `randomUUID` in three places — `mintRpcId`, which
 * every unary RPC went through, `createMessage`, and the conversation plugin's
 * draft attachments. Served over plain HTTP the function was simply absent,
 * and the first thing to reach for it was the readiness handshake:
 * `host.describe` threw, the catch aborted the generation, and both
 * `/api/events.*` sockets — which held that generation's abort signal — closed
 * while still CONNECTING. The supervisor retried forever, so sessions,
 * workspaces and the model picker never arrived. Unary calls kept working,
 * which is why sign-in looked fine and only the live page was dead.
 *
 * The relay reaches that page anyway. `tls: 'off'` in front of a proxy that
 * terminates elsewhere is a documented configuration here, and the plain
 * compatibility listener serves the same application, so this is not an
 * unsupported topology the relay can decline to have.
 *
 * The shim is a head script rather than a rewrite of the proxied bundle:
 * `ctx.webServer.tapIndex` already carries the **Relay** link, an inline
 * classic script runs before the deferred module the index loads, and one
 * definition on `crypto` covers all three call sites at once. Nothing in the
 * response path is buffered — `proxy/http.ts` streams bodies and must keep
 * streaming them.
 *
 * It defines nothing where the real function exists, so a TLS deployment and
 * the harness's own loopback port parse it and return. Against 0.1.2 it still
 * defines `randomUUID` on a plain-HTTP page, where nothing calls it any more:
 * harmless, and the price of one build serving both releases.
 * @module dsh-relay/secure-context

 * The shim, as it is served.
 *
 * `getRandomValues` carries no secure-context requirement, so it is present
 * exactly where `randomUUID` is missing. When even that is gone the script
 * defines nothing: an id minted from `Math.random` would be worse than the
 * failure it replaces, because the page would then look like it worked.
 *
 * The whole body is wrapped in `try`. It runs inside the harness's own index
 * response, where anything thrown at parse time takes the application down
 * with it.

 * opening head tag regardless, which is where the harness renders its own
 * structured head rows.

 * A document with neither a head nor a body element is returned unchanged
 * rather than having the script prepended. Prepending would put an element
 * ahead of `<!doctype html>`, and a doctype that is not the first token is
 * ignored — the page would render in quirks mode, which is a worse failure
 * than the one this fixes.
 * @param html - the index document as the frontend server rendered it.
 * @returns the document with the shim, or unchanged when it is already
