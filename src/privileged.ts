/**
 * The harness methods the relay keeps to the machine running the harness.
 *
 * Through harness 0.1.1 this was a mirror. The harness pinned its own
 * `PRIVILEGED_METHODS` list, re-checking each entry against an empty trusted
 * list so only a genuine loopback caller reached them, and the relay's `Host`
 * rewrite would have silently lifted that pin — so the relay re-imposed the
 * same list before proxying.
 *
 * **Harness 0.1.2 deleted that list.** There is no method tier left upstream:
 * the whole `/api` surface is authenticated uniformly, and possession of a
 * browser session authorizes all of it — the same authority the web app has
 * after creating a session. So this is no longer a mirror of anything. It is
 * the relay's own policy, and the only thing standing between a paired phone
 * and the operator's credential store.
 *
 * That difference matters for how the list is maintained. A mirror could be
 * checked for drift against the harness; this cannot, because there is nothing
 * to check it against. It is a judgement about which operations a *remote*
 * device should reach, and it is deliberately conservative: an endpoint this
 * list does not name is reachable by any paired device.

/**
 * Remote endpoints the relay serves only to loopback callers under
 * `privilegedMethods: 'loopback-only'`.
 *
 * They are privileged for two different reasons. The settings and credential
 * domains mutate the operator's configuration and secret store, and READING
 * them is equally sensitive: `settings/describe` returns every exposed
 * namespace and `credentials/describe` reports whether an arbitrary
 * environment variable is configured and where from. `directoryPicker/*` and
 * `session/openWorkspacePath` act on the host desktop. `llm/discoverModels`
 * carries a draft credential and makes the host issue a request to a URL the
 * caller chose, which probes whatever the host can reach and the client
 * cannot. Agent-preset authoring names the plugins a session runs.
 *
 * Endpoint names are `namespace/method`, matching the 0.1.2 wire. The 0.1.1
 * `domain.method` spelling is retained alongside each so one relay build keeps
 * gating correctly against either harness — a name that no longer exists
 * simply never matches.
